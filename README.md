## Introduction

Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). It's known for its scalability, fault tolerance, and support for building distributed systems. I'm currently exploring Elixir and building various small programs to practice the syntax, paradigms, and libraries.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Elixir installed on your local machine. Follow the instructions below to install Elixir.
